armv4vm
=======

**armv4vm** is an incomplete but usable implementation of an ARMv4 processor. Although this implementation is based on booklet 4 of the ARM7TDMI-S instructions set, no particular feature to this processor has been developed. So this implemenation is probably common to a wide range of ARM cpu.

Because used in a larger project, software interrupts, coprocessor operations and thumb mode have not been implemented in this VM.

Please send your feedback, bug reports, feature requests.

## Requirements

Optional but recommended to run unit tests, have Qt5.

## Contributions

Making a debugger usable would be an awesome stuff ! Any helps around this or other will be appreciate.
